<h2 align="left">But a little bit about me first!</h2>

###

<p align="left">I'm a 16 y/o from Gdańsk, a beautiful city in Poland. I’m currently in my 3rd year of Liceum. I’ve always been into engineering - it actually started by building sumo robots with Lego! Since then, I’ve gone down a lot of rabbit holes: Arduino, cybersecurity and hacking, STM32, my beloved Linux, FPV drones, and even material engineering (yup, I really needed the best polymer for my sumo robot, it was hard, okay?).<br><br>Now I’m building really advanced robots. I design my own PCBs, custom parts, and even manufacture my own gearboxes. Below is my latest project: a mini sumo bot (10x10cm, up to 500g) named "Evangelion." It’s running on a custom PCB (based around stm32g series) and has way too overpowered brushed motors. The combined power is basically the same as a gaming laptop or a small vacuum cleaner. Photos are below. I use Autodesk Inventor for the mechanics and Altium Designer for the electronics.</p>

<h2 align="left">Going back to my new project, Voron CIDEX</h2>

###

<p align="left">For about a year, I’ve been thinking about building a proper 3D printer. Right now, my brother prints parts for our robots on his crappy old Ender... It’s usable, but far from perfect. Plus, we can't really do complex projects because of its limitations. A few months ago, I stumbled upon IDEX and multi-toolhead printers and fell in love with the concept. The only problem is that an IDEX machines are not exactly... Anyway, back to the topic. This repo will cover my build, the problems I face, and my experience building a Voron CIDEX with features like:<br>    <br>    - 220x220x220mm build volume<br><br>    - Heated chamber rated for up to 100°C<br><br>    - Filtration system<br><br>    - Two completly independent toolheads (CIDEX)<br><br>    - CoreXY architecture<br><br>    - Belted Z drive<br><br>    - Auto bed mesh and Z-offset<br><br>    - Auto toolhead offset calibration<br><br>    - Optional CPAP cooling</p>

<p align="left">I'm trying to make this project as simple and accessible as I can, so everyone can use it for their own future projects, keeping the RepRap spirit alive.</p>

<p align="left">Big shoutout to "Made with Layers (Thomas Sanladerer)", "The Next Layer", "3DJake", and for their work, which inspired me to dive into this rabbit hole.<br><br>PS. Also big thanks to my brother for late night tech-talks aboud 3D printers and robotics...</p>
